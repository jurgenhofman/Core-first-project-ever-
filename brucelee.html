                <p>
                   The true Bruce Lee fans know the movie fragment in which he explain his philosophy about the concept of 'Being like water'. The true fans also know Bruce Lee for his inhuman physique, which he accomplished by training hard every day, and some times pushing it too far.

                <p> Bruce Lee's true power came from the combination of inhuman strenght, incredible speed, tremendous power and flexibility. Bruce possessed all of these traits at the same time, which is  a very hard thing to accomplish.<br><br> He trained his power by punching the heavy bag, he did powerlifting(and badly injured his back) to increase is strength and of course did the famous two finger push up.  Lee was the living evidence that the human body is capable of achieving amazing things, but you have to escape your limits. May this man be an inspiration to everybody who wants to push his own limits!</p>
