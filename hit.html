                   George "Hit" Richards holds 15 international certificates as personal trainer. He trains his body with calisthenic exercises and sometimes punching the speedbag. For cardio he loves to use the jump rope and that is about it. In this video he shows some exercises that he performs during a workout routine. Who says calisthenics doesn't grow muscles?
