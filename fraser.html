                    Crossfit is perhaps the best fitness regimen in the world to really get fit. It focusses on the development of your body on basically all aspects. By combining elements of HIIT, Olympic weightlifting, plyometrics, powerlifting, gymnastics and calisthenics (to name a few) and incorporating them in functional movements this fitness regimen will accomplish a true fit body. <br><br>
                    
                    Matt Fraser is the true CrossFit king of the world at this moment, winning the offical 2016 CrossFit games.

This means that each contestant has to be ready and prepared for anything. This element of surprise also means that contestants cannot prepare themselves for the exercises like for example weightlifters can. This guarantees that the winner is truely the fittest man on earth. Let's see what it takes to proclaim this titel:
