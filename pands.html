                   You see most guys in the gym bending the iron (and most of them doing it the wrong way), trying to get bigger and bigger. But very few are actually working on other essentials of being fit: like stamina, speed and flexibility. <br>The main reason for this is that most of them think that training for speed, conditioning and flexibility will result in the loss of muscle in some way. Well if you pay attention to your nutrition this a fairytale. <br><br> So lets start with speed. Ask yourself why you never pay attention to training your speed, because you can get stronger and bigger in the gym, but all that strength is worth nothing without speed! After all, the legend Bruce Lee did not defeat Kareem Abdul Jabbar because he was stronger and definitely not because he was bigger, he defeated him because of his combination of power and speed.<br><br> For those of you who are still afraid of losing muscle: The guys from Strength Camp will show you different exercises which combine strength and speed, try it out yourself!
