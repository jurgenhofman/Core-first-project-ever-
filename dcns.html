                <p>Ever heard the story of Demetrius Crawford? He started his college career in 2006 at Montana State Univesity where he had some fenomenal years, putting together the fifth-best rushing season in school history. His 2,182 career rushing yards moved him into seventh in school history. He also became the first Bobcat since 2001 to have a 1,000 yeard season, the first Bobcat running back to earn First Team ALL-Big Sky honors since 2002 and a two time Big Sky Conference player of the week.<br>
                <br>
                In 2009 he entered the NFL draft but went undrafted. He played in the Indoor Football League with the Tri-Cities Fever for 2 games. He got a contract with the CFL to play fo the BC Lions but was unable to participate due to injury.<br>
                <br>
                Crawford spent a year out of the league recovering, but decided not to give up on his dream to play football at the highest level again. He shared a motivational video of him working out. The result? Crawford got contracted again by the Saskatchewan Roughriders #DreamChasersNeverSleep. </p>

                <h4>Beach training</h4>
                <p>Training on the beach makes conditioning training even harder. The more power you'll use the more your grip in the sand will fade. Training on the beach provides a lot of extra resistance which makes the training more intense and challenging. </p>
                <h4>Pool training</h4>
                <p>Lifting weights in the pool is even more challenging than in the gym. Just like sand, water gives great resistance as well plus the benefit is that it prevents injuries that are the result of heavy lifting. </p>
