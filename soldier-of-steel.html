                    Henry Cavill has shown that he can transform his body into a super heroes body. For the movie Immortals he leaned out to get the body like ancient Greek heroes used to have, but for the movie Man of Steel and Batman vs Superman he took it to another level.<br><br>He started bulking to gain mass, starting by eating 5000 calories per day and performing mostly heavy weight exersises like olympic lifting, deadlifts and squats. After he reached his targeted weight he began leaning out, meaning eating less calories per day (at first 4000 and then back to 2000 - 2500) and following a different training pattern. Heavy weight lifting exersises were complemented by body weight exersises for the toaning of his muscles and functional training to increase his stamina.<br><br> This functional training was the real challenge and the finisher of the transformation. This training, as you see in the video below, is inspired by the training that US soldiers get put trough.
