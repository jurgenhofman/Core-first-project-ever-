                <p>
                   The Navy SEAL training is arguably the toughest training in the world for one main reason: You must be in excellent physical condition and pass the PST before you can even be considered a candidate. The PST is a screening test and it consists of the folowing:<br><br>
                    - Swim 500 yards breast or side stroke<br>
                    - Push-ups in tow minutes (at least 42)<br>
                    - Sit-ups in two minutes (at least 50)<br>
                    - Pull-ups (without break)<br>
                    - Run 1.5 miles<br><br>
                    
                    If you are able to accomplish the above, you might be eligable for the SEAL training. The training will consist of both physical and mental challenges, packed together in the BUD period, which includes Hell Week. During this period your physical strength and mental toughness will be put to the test in basic conditioning training, combat diving and land warfare training. <br><br>
                    
                    Since we are fitness fanatics we will show you the exercises that might help you pass the PST training. The rest is up to you!
